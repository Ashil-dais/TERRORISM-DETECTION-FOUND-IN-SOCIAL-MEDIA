<h1>TERRORISM DETECTION FOUND IN SOCIAL MEDIA</h1>
<hr><p>Since if such content is published on social media, it can spread vast
unrest and agitation in public of any city, state or nation. Hence a need is there to
automatically detect such content in real time and prevent from being uploaded on
internet or disabled/removed from social media site if anywhere by chance.</p><ul>
<li>In this system we combine ML  approaches to build a model that automatically detects
terrorist supporters on social media from their comments using tweets after  terrorist
attacks in different countries across the globe. The Sentimental analysis based approach
stage involved building a training dataset of labelled tweets as being positive, negative or
neutral. In the ML stage, only positive and negative labelled tweets were used to build a
classification model for feature extraction. Thus the objective is completed and system
work efficiently</li>

</ul><h2>Project Status</h2>
<hr><p>completed</p><h2>Improvements</h2>
<hr><ul>
<li>In future machine learning can be improved and terrorist activities can be recognized and detected in wide platform. Super fast: Making real time decision ,Machine learning is assessing individual   customer behavior as it happens.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Scalable: Machine learning system improve with larger datasets because this gives the system more examples of good and bad.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Efficient: Machine learning does all the dirty work of data analysis in a fraction of the time.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>This study has been made possible due to the cooperation assistance and conservative
suggestions of many to whom I would like to express my sincere gratitude and thanks. First
of all, I thank Lord Almighty for his abundant blessings bestowed us for the successful
completion of Internship training.</li>
